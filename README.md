# Full Text Search Experiments

This project contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks designed to help you understand how
full-text search works. This was prepared for a talk at Frappe Build 2025.

     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

## Setting up Jupyter Notebook

1. Install Jupyter Notebook in the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

2. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the provided link in your browser to access the notebook interface.

## Notes
